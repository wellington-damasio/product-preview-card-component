## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM CSS Naming Conventinon
- CSS Custom Properties


### What I learned

I learned how to use the `<picture>` tag along with the `<souce>` tag to create a responsive image. It makes the image change based on the size of the screen
```html
<picture class="card__img">
  <source 
  srcset="/images/image-product-desktop.jpg"
  media="(min-width: 40em)"
  />
  <img 
    src="./images/image-product-mobile.jpg"
    alt="Perfume laid in a table with some leafs"
  />  
</picture>
```

I learned how to use the `::after` CSS property to style the price without discount.
```css
.card__price {
  display: inline-block;
  position: relative;
  color: var(--dark-cyan);
  font-size: 2rem;
  line-height: 2rem;
  font-family: 'Fraunces', serif;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

.card__price::after {
  content: '$169.99';
  position: absolute;
  font-size: .8rem;
  font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;
  color: var(--dark-grayishBlue);
  text-decoration: line-through;
  right: -4rem;
}
```


### Continued development
- Get better at using the BEM naming convention for classes;
- Build more component challenges to get the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and how to build interesting pieces of an application.
